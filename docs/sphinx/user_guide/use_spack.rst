*****************************************************************
Use Spack to install dependencies and configure the project build
*****************************************************************

   The Shared Build Infrastructure turns a specified target into installed
   dependencies and a CMake cached configuration file. We chose spack as the
   core tool to accomplish this task.

We start with the Shared Build Infrastructure, where Spack is used to install
the dependencies and generate a configuration file for the build. In RADIUSS
projects, Uberenv drives Spack which itself is configured with RADIUSS Spack
Configs.

.. note::
   In Spack, packages that inherit from the CachedCMakePackage class generate a
   CMake Cached configuration file during the project build. `MFEM`_ stands out
   as the only non-CMake project that also generates a configuration file that
   is used in the CI workflow with Uberenv.

=========
Why Spack
=========

Spack provides a single context to express *toolchains*, *machine setup* and
*build sequence*. Using it allows us to share configuration files that
describe toolchain and machine setup. `RADIUSS Spack Configs`_ is the
repository where RADIUSS projects Spack configuration is shared.

Spack is increasingly used to install dependency trees of
large simulation codes. As such, it makes sense to use Spack early in the
development process.

.. note::
   We are not promoting a "Spack everywhere" strategy. But we advocate that
   Spack should be *one of the ways* to configure and build your project,
   since it will likely be built that way when used in production.

===========
End product
===========

The end product should be a script that takes a Spack spec as an input, and
returns the configuration file generated by Spack after installing the
dependencies for the given spec.

We rely on `Uberenv`_ to facilitate the setup of a local and isolated spack
instance that will be used to build the project dependencies. We strongly
suggest that you start with Uberenv to benefit from a reliable Spack usage in
your CI (tried and tested) and keep your script simple.

=============
Uberenv Guide
=============

The role of Uberenv is to set up your Spack instance and then drive Spack to
install your project dependencies and generate the configuration file.

.. note::
   Uberenv will create a directory ``uberenv_libs`` containing a Spack
   instance with the required project dependencies installed. Spack then
   generates a CMake configuration file (``<config_dependent_name>.cmake``)
   at the root of the project repository.

   One common source of error when using Uberenv is when the ``uberenv_libs``
   folder is out of date after a Spack update. To resolve, make sure this
   ``uberenv_libs`` is deleted before running it again for the first time
   because it needs to be regenerated.


Getting Uberenv as a submodule (recommended)
============================================

#. Get ``uberenv.py`` script.

    Use ``git submodule add`` to get `Uberenv`_ into a ``uberenv`` directory.

#. Edit the ``.uberenv_config.json`` file.

    Create the ``.uberenv_config.json`` file in a directory that is a parent 
    of the ``uberenv`` directory. A typical project places the file in the
    top-level directory of its repository. Set your project package name, and 
    other parameters like Spack reference commit/tag (we suggest the latest 
    release tag).

#. Add RADIUSS Spack Configs submodule.

    * Use ``git submodule add`` to get `RADIUSS Spack Configs`_ in a second
      submodule or custom location.

    * In ``.uberenv_config.json`` set ``spack_configs_path`` to point to
      ``<some_relative_path>/radiuss-spack-configs``.

#. Add custom packages.

    If you need to make local modifications to your project package or a
    dependency package, you may put it in a corresponding directory:
    ``<some_relative_path>/packages/<package_name>/package.py``.

    Then, in ``.uberenv_config.json``, set ``spack_packages_path`` to point to
    ``<some_relative_path>/packages``

#. Make sure that the ``package.py`` file for your project generates a CMake 
   configuration file.

    This is usually done adding a specific stage to the package. In particular,
    Spack now supports this for CMake build system with the CacheCMakePackages
    class. (see :ref:`generate-config-file` for details, and Umpire, CHAI, RAJA
    for implementation examples).


Getting Uberenv by clone/fetch/copy
===================================

#. Get ``uberenv.py`` script.

    Clone/Fetch/Copy it from `Uberenv`_ repository.
    into a ``uberenv`` directory, not as a submodule.

#. Edit ``uberenv_config.json``.

    Set your project package name, and other parameters like Spack reference
    commit/tag (we suggest the latest release tag).

#. Add RADIUSS Spack Configs submodule.

    * Use ``git submodule add`` to get `RADIUSS Spack Configs`_.

    * Create a symlink ``uberenv/spack_configs`` that points to
      ``radiuss-spack-configs``.

#. Add custom packages.

    | If you need to make local modifications to your project package or a
      dependency package, you may put it in a corresponding directory:
    | ``uberenv/packages/<package_name>/package.py``.

#. Make sure that the ``package.py`` file for your project generates a CMake 
   configuration file.

    This is usually done adding a specific stage to the package. In particular,
    Spack now supports this for CMake build system with the CacheCMakePackages
    class. (see :ref:`generate-config-file` for details, and Umpire, CHAI, RAJA
    for implementation examples).


==================================
Get the shared Spack configuration
==================================

We share Spack configuration files in `RADIUSS Spack Configs`_. In this repo
you will find:

* `config.yaml` for Spack general configuration.
* `modules.yaml` for modules creation by Spack.
* One `compilers.yaml` and `packages.yaml` per system type, describing the
  installed toolchain on each machine.
* a `packages` directory containing some Spack packages tuned for our
  needs.

Depending on the machine/system, we may or may not provide a spack
configuration allowing you to use it right away. Please refer to
`RADIUSS Spack Configs`_ documentation about adding a new machine. This will be
welcome by the RADIUSS teams using it!

.. note::
   MacOS (darwin): it is not trivial to provide a universal configuration for
   MacOS.  Instead, developers will likely have to complete the
   ``packages.yaml`` file in order to adapt the location and version of
   externally installed dependencies. MacOS is not available on LC systems, the
   Spack configuration is provided as-is, for development use.

.. _generate-config-file:

=========================================================
Setup your Spack package to generate a configuration file
=========================================================

We want to build the dependencies with Spack and then build the project with
those dependencies outside of Spack. We need to generate a CMake
configuration file that reproduces the configuration `Spack`_ would have
generated in the same context. It should contain all the information necessary
to build your project with the described toolchain and dependencies.

In particular, the configuration file should setup:

* flags corresponding with the target requested (Release, Debug).
* paths to compilers and other toolkits (e.g. cuda), etc.
* paths to installed dependencies.
* any options that may impact the build.

This provides an easy way to build your project based on `Spack`_ configuration
while only using CMake and a traditional developer workflow.

CMake projects: Spack CachedCMakePackage
========================================

CMake is strongly recommended to use the RADIUSS CI workflow, mostly
because of this step. With CMake, we generate a cache file describing the
configuration necessary to build the code for a project. This is supported in 
Spack as soon as your package inherits from ``CachedCMakePackage``.

When your package is ported, stopping an installation after the 
``initconfig`` phase will prevent Spack from building your project after
the CMake configuration file is generated.

Non-CMake projects: Custom implementation
=========================================

The only example of a non-CMake project that has adopted this workflow is 
`MFEM`_.  Although it is using a Makefile build system in its Spack packages, 
MFEM is generating a configuration file that can be used just like a CMake 
configuration file. We adapted the implementation of the package to mimic the 
mechanism available in CMake-based packages. You may use that as an example.
