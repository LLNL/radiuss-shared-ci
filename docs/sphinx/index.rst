RADIUSS Shared CI
#################

The RADIUSS Shared CI project provides a *templated CI infrastructure for
GitLab* that we intend to be sufficiently flexible and general to be adopted
and shared by any LLNL open-source projects hosted on GitHub.

The infrastructure is project-agnostic. Each machine we support has a templated
pipeline ready for use. Users only need to add jobs for machines of interest
and set some variables according to their needs.

Projects using the RADIUSS Shared CI infrastructure keep control over their
build and test process. The pre-requisite being that this process can be
invoked through a single command line.

A project is then built and tested as usual and *most of the CI infrastructure
is shared* to reduce duplicated effort and ease maintenance for individual
projects.

.. note:: LLNL's RADIUSS project (Rapid Application Development via an
   Institutional Universal Software Stack) aims to broaden usage across LLNL
   and the open source community of a set of libraries and tools used for HPC
   scientific application development.


========
Overview
========

*In a hurry? Quickstart instructions can be found in* :ref:`instructions`.

Who is this for?
================

Your project is hosted on GitHub and you want to run tests on Livermore
Computing (LC) systems through the LC GitLab instance. You don't have the
bandwidth to train your team on the intricacies of GitLab CI/CD or you don't
want to reinvent the wheel by writing your own CI/CD configuration from
scratch.

RADIUSS Shared CI gets you started shortly with a templated CI infrastructure
that is flexible enough to be adapted to your needs, but general enough to be
shared with other projects.

System requirements/prerequisites
=================================

You'll need an account on LC GitLab instance and a project hosted in the LLNL
organization on GitHub that can be built and tested with a single command line.

More specifically:

- At least one team member must have an account on the LC GitLab instance.

- You will need a script to drive the builds and tests of your project. We
  enforce this recommendation for technical reasons, but it also guarantees
  that the CI behavior can be reproduced locally and keeps the yaml files
  readable.

Getting started
===============

The steps necessary to adopt the RADIUSS Shared CI methodology are documented
in the :doc:`RADIUSS Shared CI User Guide <user_guide/setup_ci>`.

Contributing
============

In the  :doc:`RADIUSS Shared CI Developer Guide <dev_guide/radiuss_ci_explained>`,
we discuss the layout of the RADIUSS Shared CI infrastructure and how the
different pieces work together. Technical choices are also explained there.


=========================
Background and Motivation
=========================

LLNL open-source projects are prevalently hosted on GitHub. However, for those
meant to run on Livermore Computing (LC) systems, testing automatically on LC
GitLab instance is paramount.

Initially, the RADIUSS Shared CI infrastructure was designed for projects also
using Spack to describe the toolchain and build the dependencies. This "build
infrastructure" is defined in `RADIUSS Spack Configs`_ documentation.

===========================================
Cool features provided by RADIUSS Shared CI
===========================================

* A shared configuration, for reduced maintenance.
* Ability to define your jobs command and add as many jobs as desired.
* Leverage GitLab child pipelines to keep the pipeline readable.
* Each child pipeline reports independently to GitHub: one status per machine.
* Projects can extend their pipeline at will with additional stages.
* Print an exact reproducer in the logs.
* Provide a template for a pipeline dedicated to performance measurements.
* Optimize machine usage with shared allocation (optional).
* Filter out pipelines coming from a mirrored draft Pull Request (optional).
