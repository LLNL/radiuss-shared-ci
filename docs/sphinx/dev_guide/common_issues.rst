If you are attempting to use a specific reference in ``radiuss-shared-ci``, make
sure this reference has been mirrored on LC GitLab: be sure to create a PR on
GitHub so that the mirroring happens.

This error may arise when developing on a new branch in ``radiuss-shared-ci``,
The development repository is on GitHub.com but in the CI configuration we
recommend that projects point to the LC GitLab clone.

This error appears if you leave ``CUSTOM_CI_BUILDS_DIR: ""`` uncommented in
``.gitlab/custom-variables.yml`` as suggested in earlier version, typically
when no service account is in use.

Simply comment that line. Setting the variable to an empty value generates
a failure in the runner initialization script.
