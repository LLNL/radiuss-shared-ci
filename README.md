# RADIUSS Shared CI

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC)
open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a
wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code
targeting HPC platforms.

Radiuss Shared CI allows project to share CI configuration for GitLab.

## Getting Started

This project is meant to be hosted in a Gitlab instance so that other projects
can import files from it to complete their CI configuration.

User documentation is located here: [**RADIUSS Shared CI Docs**](https://radiuss-shared-ci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Installing

This project requires no installation.

## Versioning

version: v2024.12.0

When a new version of RADIUSS Shared CI is released, we use the current year and month to set the version number,
followed by a "minor" index which we increase in case we need a hotfix.

This is coherent with how most projects using RADIUSS Shared CI deal with versioning and helps syncing with other
utilities, like [RADIUSS Spack configs](https://gitlab.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs).
