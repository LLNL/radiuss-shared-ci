# RADIUSS Shared CI

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC)
open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a
wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code
targeting HPC platforms.

Radiuss Shared CI allows project to share CI configuration for GitLab.

## Getting Started
