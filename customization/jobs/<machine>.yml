# Explanations:
###############
# RADIUSS Shared CI provides a pipeline for each machine, where a template job
# is provided. Each of your jobs must extend this template to be added to the
# list of jobs running on the associated machine.
#
# The job template then expects you to define the "JOB_CMD" variable with the
# one line command used to trigger the build and test of your project.
#
# We suggest that you set your command in such a way that you can then
# customize it per job with variables. E.g.:
# "./path/to/my_ci_script ${A_VARIABLE}"

## Adding jobs defined by the project.
## Note: placing the extends section first allows you to override part of the
## shared implementation if needed (and if you know what you are doing).
#<job-name (typically build target description)>:
#  extends: .job_on_<machine>
#  variables:
#    <A_VARIABLE>: "<with job specific value>"
